# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

This repository is intentionally **architecture-driven** and
values clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability.

---

## Before You Start

Please open an issue to discuss:
- architectural changes
- new features
- workflow or automation behavior

This helps align expectations and avoid rework.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused
- Follow existing service-layer patterns
- Do not introduce framework logic into domain or services
- Prefer explicit code over clever abstractions
- Add comments where behavior may not be obvious

---

## Scope & Expectations

This project is:
- backend-first
- configuration-driven
- workflow-centric

The following are currently out of scope:
- full frontend applications
- SaaS/multi-tenant setups
- enterprise-specific customizations

---

## Pull Requests

- One logical change per pull request
- Reference an existing issue where applicable
- Describe *why* the change exists, not just *what* it does

Pull requests may be declined if they conflict with
the architectural direction of the project.
