# AXTURION Enterprise

AXTURION is built as an open-core recruitment infrastructure platform.

The core remains fully functional, transparent, and self-hostable.

The Enterprise layer exists to reinforce governance, operational maturity, and institutional stability in regulated environments.

---

## Why Enterprise Exists

Large organizations — especially in governance and defense contexts — require more than a working workflow engine.

They require:

- Formal lifecycle guarantees
- Structured access control
- Identity integration
- Compliance tooling
- Operational hardening
- Controlled upgrade paths

These are not feature requests.
They are institutional requirements.

The Enterprise layer addresses these needs without compromising the open core.

---

## What Remains Open

AXTURION Core will always provide:

- Workflow engine with strict transition validation
- Workflow-scoped isolation
- Deterministic reporting
- Audit logging
- API-first architecture
- On-premise deployment capability

No artificial feature restrictions.
No functional lockouts.

Core remains sovereign.

## Enterprise Scope (Strategic Direction)

Enterprise capabilities may include:

### Governance & Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions
- Separation-of-duties enforcement
- Approval-based workflow mutations

### Identity Integration
- SSO (OIDC / SAML)
- IAM federation
- Policy enforcement integration

### Compliance & Audit
- Advanced audit exports
- Immutable audit snapshots
- Retention policy tooling
- Regulatory reporting templates

### Operational Tooling
- Hardened deployment templates
- Backup automation
- Migration tooling
- Long-term support branches
- Upgrade stability guarantees

---

## Architectural Separation Principle

Enterprise must:

- Not corrupt core integrity
- Not introduce hidden runtime behavior
- Not break API contracts
- Remain modular and detachable

Core = Engine  
Enterprise = Governance Reinforcement

---

## Deployment Philosophy

Enterprise deployments prioritize:

- On-premise infrastructure
- Air-gapped compatibility
- Sovereign data control
- Institutional lifecycle management

Cloud support is optional.
Sovereignty is fundamental.

---

## Long-Term Positioning

AXTURION is not positioned as a feature-driven ATS.

It is positioned as:

Recruitment Infrastructure for Governance Markets.

Open Core builds trust.
Enterprise builds institutional resilience.
