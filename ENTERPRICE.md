# MATS Enterprise

MATS is built as an open-core recruitment infrastructure platform.

The core engine remains open, transparent and extensible.
The Enterprise layer strengthens governance, security and operational control
for organizations operating in regulated or mission-critical environments.

This document explains the positioning and scope of the Enterprise layer.

---

# 1. Open Core Philosophy

MATS Core will always provide:

- Workflow engine with strict transition validation
- Workflow-scoped isolation
- Deterministic reporting
- Audit logging
- API-first architecture
- On-premise deployment capability
- Full source transparency

Core is designed to be self-hosted and extendable.

No hidden business logic.
No locked workflows.
No artificial limitations.

---

# 2. Why an Enterprise Layer Exists

Large organizations — especially in governance markets — require:

- Formal support guarantees
- Operational stability assurances
- Structured upgrade paths
- Role and permission governance
- Integration with identity providers
- Compliance tooling
- Deployment and lifecycle management tooling

These concerns are not feature additions.
They are organizational requirements.

The Enterprise layer exists to provide this institutional maturity.

# 3. What Enterprise Adds (Strategic Scope)

The Enterprise layer may include:

## Governance & Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions
- Separation of duties enforcement
- Approval-based workflow mutations

## Identity & Security Integration
- SSO integration (OIDC, SAML)
- External IAM federation
- Audit export connectors
- Security policy enforcement hooks

## Operational Tooling
- Backup and restore automation
- Deployment templates (on-prem hardened setups)
- Migration tooling
- Long-term support branches
- Upgrade path guarantees

## Reporting & Compliance
- Advanced reporting exports
- Regulatory audit support
- Immutable audit snapshotting
- Data retention policy tooling

# 4. What Enterprise Is NOT

Enterprise is NOT:

- A separate product
- A SaaS-only offering
- A replacement of the core
- A feature lock model

Core remains functional and complete.
Enterprise enhances institutional governance.

---

# 5. Deployment Model

MATS Enterprise is designed primarily for:

- On-premise environments
- Air-gapped infrastructure
- Regulated industries
- Defense and government
- Critical infrastructure sectors

Cloud deployments are possible,
but the architecture prioritizes sovereign control.

---

# 6. Support & Lifecycle Philosophy

Enterprise deployments may include:

- Defined support SLAs
- Security patch guarantees
- Version lifecycle commitments
- Architecture review support
- Modernization advisory

The goal is long-term infrastructure stability,
not rapid feature churn.

---

# 7. Architectural Separation Principle

The Enterprise layer must:

- Not corrupt core integrity
- Not introduce hidden runtime behavior
- Not break API contracts
- Remain modular and detachable

Core remains the foundation.
Enterprise adds governance structure.

---

# 8. Strategic Positioning

MATS is not a startup recruitment tool.

It is a recruitment infrastructure platform.

Core = Engine  
Enterprise = Governance framework  

This separation allows organizations to:

- Retain sovereignty
- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Maintain extensibility
- Operate under formal governance constraints

---

# 9. Long-Term Vision

MATS aims to become:

A modular recruitment infrastructure platform
for governance-driven markets.

Open core builds trust.
Enterprise builds institutional resilience.
